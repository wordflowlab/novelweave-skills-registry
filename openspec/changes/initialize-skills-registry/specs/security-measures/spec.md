# Security Measures

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Four-Layer Defense System

The registry SHALL implement a four-layer defense system to protect against malicious Skills:
- Layer 1: Automated format and accessibility validation

- **AND** prevent post-checkout hooks from running
- **AND** prevent any malicious hook execution

### Requirement: Content Safety Policy

Skills SHALL be constrained to safe, read-only content:

- **THEN** NovelWeave SHALL NOT use eval() or similar
- **AND** SHALL NOT execute shell commands from Skill content
- **AND** SHALL NOT dynamically import code from Skills
- **AND** SHALL treat all Skill content as data, not code

### Requirement: Threat Model and Mitigations

- Residual Risk: Eliminated (âœ…)

Threat: Malicious links
- Risk Level: Medium (ðŸŸ¡)
- Mitigation: Human review
- Residual Risk: Low, requires vigilance (ðŸŸ¡)

Threat: Inappropriate content
- Risk Level: Medium (ðŸŸ¡)
- Mitigation: Human review
- Residual Risk: Low, requires vigilance (ðŸŸ¡)

Threat: Prompt injection
- Risk Level: Low (ðŸŸ¢)
- Mitigation: AI system inherent limits
- Residual Risk: Acceptable (ðŸŸ¢)

Threat: Information misleading
- Risk Level: Low (ðŸŸ¢)
- Mitigation: Community ratings + official verification
- Residual Risk: Acceptable (ðŸŸ¢)

#### Scenario: Threat documentation

- **WHEN** new threat is identified
